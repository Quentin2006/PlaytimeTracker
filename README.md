Increments a file based on desired .exe, creates a .txt file will corresponding names. Currently working on making this data viewable from a web page
EX. if GhostOfTsushima.exe is in exe_names and is open, GhostOfTsushimaPlaytime.txt will be created holding playtime inside.


NOTE: MAKE SURE TO CHANGE increment_var = 60 IN tracker.py

NOTE: for some reason when running app.py it runs main twice???
